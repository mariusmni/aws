### Introduction

[Amazon EC2 RunCommand](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/run-command/) is a feature that allows you to manage a fleet of amazon instances by automating common administrative tasks like executing Shell scripts and commands on Linux. This is great if you want to run the same command on all the instances. However, one may want to run commands that behave differently depending on the instance. For example, if you want to process certain datasets in parallel, you probably want every instance to process a different dataset. This idea is not new to parallel processing. For example, the [Message Passing Interface (MPI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface) allows each processor to have a different behaviour depending on a processor rank or index. 

This page explains how to emulate the MPI behaviour on [AWS RunCommand](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/run-command/). In other words, we want each instance to have a numerical index. This way, we can run the same script on a fleet of EC2 instances, where the script behaves differently depending on the instance index. The instance index can be generated as follows.

### How to assign a unique index to every instance

Assume we have a fleet of EC2 linux instances. Every instance in the fleet already has an instance ID. The instance ID can be retrieved from METADATA as follows:

`
curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/instance-id
`

The output will be something like: `i-67a6a8a3`

For our purpose, we want every instance to have an index between 0 and size of fleet - 1. A simple way to do this is to create a script, say `number.sh`, that does `echo <index>`, where index differs from instance to instance. The script can be created manually, but for a large fleet we can use RunCommand itself to generate the `number.sh` script, as follows. 

For this example, our fleet has only two instances:

```
i-67a6a8a3
i-cea5ab0a
```

We can execute the following through RunCommand to generate the `number.sh` script:

```
#!/bin/bash

# mapping between instance ID and index
declare -A num
num=(
  [i-67a6a8a3]=0
  [i-cea5ab0a]=1
)

# get instance ID of the current instance
instanceID="`curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/instance-id`"

# get index for the current instance
index=${num[$instanceID]}

# generate number.sh script and make it executable
echo "echo $index" > /number.sh
chmod +x /number.sh
```

The above script has a mapping between instance IDs and numerical indices. When it runs, it converts the instance ID to its numerical index. It then generates the `number.sh` script which echoes the index. The path of the `number.sh` script in this example is the root folder (/) for simplicity. To test that the script was generated, we can run it via RunCommand:

`
/number.sh
`

The outputs should be `0` or `1` depending on the instance.

### How to personalize command based on index

In this section, we will clone a particular program from github, generate a random input dataset, then run the program on the dataset. The dataset will be generated by using the instance index as a random number generator seed. Thus, every instance runs on a unique dataset.

For this example, we will clone the git project [qpms9](https://github.com/mariusmni/qpms9), which solves the [Planted Motif Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planted_motif_search) problem. The problem itself is not important for our discussion. The project comes with an input dataset generator. We will use the generator to create different datasets depending on the instance index. Then we will run the qpms9 program on each dataset and save the outputs to an s3 bucket.

The following commands assume that you have `git`, `make` and `g++` installed. You can install them using something like 
``` 
sudo apt-get install git make g++
```
on ubuntu, or

```
sudo yum install git make gcc-c++
```

on amazon linux/redhat.


To get and build the qpms9 program we have to run the following via RunCommand. For working dir use `/tmp`.
